   <h1>TMT 2654 Web Based System Development </h1>
   <h1>Course Coordinator/Lecturer</h1>

    <h2>Description </h2>
	<div><p> The course focuses on designing and developing Web-based applications using a variety of programming languages and tools.
	          Students will be exposed to Internet application development architecture.We will learn to create web pages using HTML specifically 
	          XHTML language. Topics also include tables, frames and also form creation in HTML. We will learn design concepts in cascading style 
	          sheets. We will then venture into web scripting with Java scripts, the primary client-side scripting language of the Internet. We will 
	          also review object oriented programming paradigm. We then jump into PHP, one of the worldâ€™s most popular programming languages
              for web development. It is a flexible, scalable and easy to program language. PHP is currently used in more than fifteen million web 
	          sites and you will learn as part of the curriculum what this language is all about. With increased familiarity on PHP, we will introduce
	           mySQL, an open source and reliable database management system that is rapidly acquiring a world-wide user base. </p>

               <p id="feelings-para"> First of all, I would like to thank Dr Lim Phei Chin, who is my lecturer of TMT 2654 in this semester. 
			   Every class i learn something new that attracted me to attend the class. 
			   web-based learning environments provide facilities for open computer-mediated communication (CMC) that allows interaction with other students.
			   I want to learn about web based system development more and more.
